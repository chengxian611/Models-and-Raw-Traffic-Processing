# Traffic-Preprocessing-Pipeline
Traffic Router is a Python-based session extraction tool and, together with the Multi-Process Feature Extraction algorithm, forms the core of our preprocessing framework. It converts raw PCAP data into structured flow files, from which multi-process feature extraction produces model-ready datasets with features, labels, and timestamps.
This repository currently includes only the core implementations of the model and data processing. The full pipeline details are still being refined and organized.
