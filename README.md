# Traffic-Preprocessing-Pipeline
Traffic Router is a Python-based session extraction tool and, together with the Multi-Process Feature Extraction algorithm, forms the core of our preprocessing framework. It converts raw PCAP data into structured flow files, from which multi-process feature extraction produces model-ready datasets with features, labels, and timestamps.
